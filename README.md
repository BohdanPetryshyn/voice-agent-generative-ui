```

### Add the Gen UI Forms script to your page:

```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/11labs-community-gen-ui-forms"></script>
```

### Configure your agent to use the Gen UI Forms

To work forms require adding instructions to the system prompt and creating additional tools.

1. Add system prompt from [`config/prompt.md`](./config/prompt.md) to the end of your agent system prompt.
2. Add tools by calling API or manually on [ElevenLabs' Dashboard](https://elevenlabs.io/app/conversational-ai/agents):
- [`create_or_update_form`](./tools/create_or_update_form.json).
- [`get_form_state`](./tools/get_form_state.json).
- [`close_form`](./tools/close_form.json).

That's it! Your agent can now use forms to collect relevant information during conversations.
